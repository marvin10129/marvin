<p> One of the very important changes to engineering education in the 1990s has been the ever more common use of computers for analysis, design, data acquisition, and control. Some of the generic computing tools that are likely to be in use in most engineering schools include Matlab, MathCad, and AutoCad. While such computer aids simplify the solution of typical electrical engineering problems, they also serve to stimulate students to experiment in developing their own solution methods. Other computer aids such as SPICE1 are useful for circuit analysis and simulation, and permit a more in-depth analysis of realistic electrical/electronic circuits and devices.  
In addition, the Internet is an increasingly common resource for knowledge and information. This course, for example, will make use of a number of handouts available from MIT â€“ a leading engineering education institution based in the US. MIT has an OpenCourseWare2 program through which they make their materials available online for use by the global community.  Typical Web references give you information on electrical engineering companies, products, and methods. Some of the sites contain tutorial material that may supplement this course.  </p1>
